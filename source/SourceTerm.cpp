// base class of sources in the solver
// NOTE: there are many different types of seismic sources, such as earthquakes,
// explosions, surface forces (ocean), and point forces (adjoint). But to the 
// solver, all those sources are seen as a combination of force vectors on solid 
// points, or of scalars on fluid points if any.
// So, if we only consider sources in the solid domain, only one class is enough
// to implement all source types.
